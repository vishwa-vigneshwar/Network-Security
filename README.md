# Java Network Security Examples

This repository contains Java code examples demonstrating SSL server-client communication and a dictionary attack simulation. These examples are intended for educational purposes to help understand and implement basic network security concepts using Java.

## Features

- **SSL Server-Client Example**: Implements a secure server and client using SSL/TLS to demonstrate encrypted communication over a network.
- **Dictionary Attack Simulation**: Simulates a dictionary attack using a simple authentication method to demonstrate the vulnerability of weak passwords.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-network-security-examples.git
cd java-network-security-examples
```

### Directory Structure

- `SSLServer.java`: Contains the SSL server implementation.
- `SSLClient.java`: Contains the SSL client implementation.
- `DictionaryAttack.java`: Contains the dictionary attack simulation code.

## Usage

To run the examples, compile and execute the Java files in your IDE or use the command line:

#### Compile the Code

```bash
javac SSLServer.java
javac SSLClient.java
javac DictionaryAttack.java
```

#### Run the Server

```bash
java SSLServer
```

#### Run the Client

In a new terminal window:

```bash
java SSLClient
```

#### Run the Dictionary Attack Simulation

```bash
java DictionaryAttack
```
